<h1>Encryption and Decryption in java</h1>
Title: Java Encryption and Decryption Program

Description:
This GitHub project, titled "Java Encryption and Decryption Program," is a Java-based program that provides a simple and interactive way to encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified key. The program consists of two classes: Encryption and Decryption_V2.

Encryption Class:
The Encryption class is responsible for encrypting a user-provided message using a randomly generated key within the range of 100 to 600. The user is prompted to enter their message, and the program then processes the message character by character, applying the encryption algorithm. The resulting cipher text and the generated key are displayed to the user.

Decryption_V2 Class:
The Decryption_V2 class serves as the counterpart to the Encryption class. It allows users to decrypt a cipher text by providing the encrypted message and the correct key. The program splits the cipher text into segments, each representing a group of characters, and then reverses the encryption process to recover the original message. The decrypted message is displayed to the user.

Both classes make use of the Scanner class to interact with the user, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.

This Java Encryption and Decryption program can be a valuable tool for learning about basic encryption techniques and can serve as a foundation for more advanced encryption and security-related projects. Feel free to explore and contribute to this open-source project on GitHub to enhance its functionality and usability.
